def permute_fast(items, unique=True):
	"""
	Lazily produce all possible permutations of items. Returns the permutations in a random order,
	and does so very quickly (without generating all possible permutations first).

	NOTE: The list of items itself is not processed lazily (that wouldn't really make any sense),
	but the list of permutations is generated lazily. (So it's safe to call this function with quite
	large values for `item`)

	NOTE: This method works by continually re-shuffling `items` (if unique=True, then it checks for
	and avoids duplicates). This means that it is non deterministic in the order it yields
	permutations. If called to completion, it should always return every permutation exactly once
	then stop (if unique=True) or keep returning random permutations forever. As a result of this,
	it returns the permutations in a random order and without needing to generate a significant
	number of permutations ahead of time, which is a very significant improvement for large lists of
	items.

	This method systematically iterates through items, so a) it runs in deterministic time, and
