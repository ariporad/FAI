    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I built an implementation of the game Nannon and several different algorithms that could play it. Some high-level discussion of my approach follows in this section, then I'll walk through my implementation in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a big believer that if you choose your data structures right, the rest of your program writes itself. (That's a rough quote from someone, but I can't remember who.) To that end, I spent a substantial amount of time during this project iterating on my data structures. Originally, I stored the board as a list, where each item in the list represented a position on the board. Legal values were `0` (spot is empty), `1` (current player's checker), and `-1` (opponent's checker). Checkers in the home and goal zones were stored separately. That data structure was simple, which was nice. However, it was easy to get into an illegal state (wrong number of checkers), which I didn't like--a good data structure is one that can't represent an illegal state, after all. It was also hard to manipulate, with lots of loops looking for checkers. I ultimately decided to switch to a representation with an (unordered) list of `Checker`s, each of which has a `Player` (black or white) and a `Position`. Initially, I attempted to have each checker's position be relative _to that checker's home_, which meant that the representation was entirely perspective-independent. That ended up being too complicated to manage, so I settled on a perspective-dependent representation where all checker positions are measured relative to one player's (the perspective player's) home. I'm still not satisfied with this representation--it simultaneously feels a little too complicated, while also needing too much perspective swapping--but it's good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of checkers (which is always `2 * checkers_per_player` long) is encapsulated by a `Board`, which also tracks the perspective (if the perspective is Black, then lower indexes are closer to Black's home and vis versa) and `GameConfiguration` (the variant of Nannon, such as `{6,3,6}` or `{8,4,6}`). `Board` contains much of the game logic, including calculating open spots, legal `Move`s, and the winner. The `Move` class trackes a possible move, and is responsible for properly executing it and returning the resulting `Board`. Finally, a `Dicestream` class wraps various iterators that can provide a stream of dice rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge-Based Player\n",
    "\n",
    "My knowledge-based Nannon player ended up somewhat similar to the score-based player, but with some key differences. It's built by assigning \"points\" to different aspects of each possible move. It picks the move with the highest total point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm's guiding principles are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checkers closer to the goal are better\n",
    "* Knocking off an opponent's checker is valuable, especially if it's close to the goal\n",
    "* Using a roll of 6 to move a checker that's 1 away from the goal is a waste\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a couple of things that I expected to result in significant improvements, but in testing either had negligible or negative impacts, so aren't part of the final algorithm:\n",
    "* Favoring protected checkers\n",
    "* Trying to account for the risk of getting trapped\n",
    "* Valuing checkers closer to the goal non-linearly (ie. a checker right next to the goal is _way_ more valuable than one right next to home)\n",
    "* Optimizing for the number of legal moves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sticking Points\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, picking (and iterating on) a set of datastructures was a big sticking point for this assignment. Building a knowledge-based player was also more difficult than anticipated--the strategies that I intuitively expected to work well weren't actually that effective, whereas the very simple score-based player was actually quite good (as, was somewhat surprisingly, the simple last-piece-first player). It's also quite possible that I'm just bad at Nannon--as any of my friends or family can attest, I'm not generally not one for playing games like these the old-fashion way. Additionally, I ran into some very very strange situations that I think are bugs in the Python interpreter, which are more thoroughly documented in `cli.py`--but basically, `Player.BLACK.long_str` would sometimes return `'White'`, but only in the PyCharm debugger and inconsistently. That was a fun one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent a substantial amount of time optimizing the performance of this solution. Running a profiler against a tournament led me to introduce significant memoization (using Python's [`functools.cache`/`functools.cached_property`][caching]) throught the system, and to optimize the equality checking and hashing of various classes. This ultimately resulted in a 2-3x performance increase over the initial version.\n",
    "\n",
    "[caching]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope I've provided enough information in this report that--as requested--you won't need to run the code. If you do, however, there are a couple of ways to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, much of the code, especially the game foundation, is unit tested through Python's [doctest][] module. Tests can be run from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# This prints nothing if the tests pass\n",
    "$ python3 -m doctest src/*.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I built a simple CLI for interacting with the game system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3 src/cli.py --help\n",
    "usage: cli.py [-h] [-n ROUNDS] [-b BOARD_SIZE] [-c CHECKERS] [-d DIE_SIZE] [-s SEED]\n",
